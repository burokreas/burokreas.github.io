# Custom CSS for the WordPress login page.

This is just a simple repository to house the custom CSS for a custom login page solution we use for WordPress. The solution is nothing more than a single file in `wp-content/mu-plugins/`, nothing fancy, but having one canonical place of where the CSS lives is what we needed and Github Pages was the solution, so here we are ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
